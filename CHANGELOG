  Written by Ivo Truxa (c) 2017 <truxa@truxoft.com>

  1.03 [Ivo Truxa] 2017/01/11
       - added other forgotten policy strings (o=!, dkim=all, dkim=discardable)
  1.02 [Ivo Truxa] 2017/01/10
       - return code 0 (enforced) or 1 (undefined) kept, but STDOUT prints a verbose result
  1.01 [Ivo Truxa] 2017/01/09
       - inversed output - 0: success = DKIM signing enforced
       -                   1: error = policy undefined or signing not enforced
       - policy loop interrupted at the 1st hit, to save time, processing power, and bandwidth
       - full policy loop for detailed verbose mode kept
       - cosmetic formatting changes, editing of help texts
